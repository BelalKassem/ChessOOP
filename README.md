# ChessOOP
This is the fully functioning chess project I created in Java as part of my Object Oriented Programming course. 

- Wrote several classes (Coordinate, Piece, Square, ChessBoard, etc) that made up the 
underlying logic of a chess game

- Tested each class by running corresponding JUnit tests to make sure that the code is 
working as expected

- Used the concept of inheritance to implement the specific legal moves pertaining to 
each chess piece as a practice in code reusability

- Built the GUI for the chess game as an exercise in interfaces, abstract classes, the 
JavaFX Event Handling Pattern as well as the Observer Pattern 

- Added an extra feature to the GUI beyond the project requirements (eliminated pieces are displayed on the left and right sides of the chess board)
